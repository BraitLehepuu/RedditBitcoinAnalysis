# RedditBitcoinAnalysis

This is a project made for the Intruduction to Data Sience Course @ University of Tartu (Autumn 2022)

# Setup

To install all the requirements
```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Since the starting data files are too big to include to github, then they will have to be seperately installed from [here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1l4xhTLOlTKfrISfpuQ6bBZEfi8gaAQuW/view?usp=share_link) and placed into the "data" folder (has to be created seperately) in the project root folder.

<sub>Original data has been gathered from [Bitcoin historical data](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/mczielinski/bitcoin-historical-data) and [Reddit comments containing "Bitcoin"](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/jerryfanelli/reddit-comments-containing-bitcoin-2009-to-2019?resource=download)</sub>

# Generating data 

Generating better data for further analysis can be done by running the jupyter notebook and executing both of the notebooks located in the "Data engineering" folder ("bitcoin_data.ipynb" and "reddit_data.ipynb")
